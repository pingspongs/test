										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trent Boult led an inspired bowling display to help New Zealand down Sri Lanka by five wickets on Thursday and move to the brink of the World Cup semi-finals.</p>
<p>Chasing a modest 172 for victory, New Zealand rode on an opening stand between Devon Conway (45) and Rachin Ravindra (42) to achieve the target with 160 balls to spare in Bengaluru.</p>
<p>The Kiwis remain in fourth position with 10 points ahead of Pakistan and Afghanistan and a with much superior net run-rate than their rivals.</p>
<p>Both Pakistan and Afghanistan need improbable victory margins in their last matches against England and South Africa respectively to have any of chance of making the final four.</p>
<p>The Black Caps, in their last league match, bounced back from four straight losses to close in on a likely semi-final clash against undefeated India.</p>
<p>Ravindra, who also took two wickets, added to his blazing form in the tournament including three centuries to edge past South Africa&#8217;s Quinton de Kock and top the batting chart with 565 runs.</p>
<p>Both left-handed openers struck regular boundaries before Dushmantha Chameera broke through with the wicket of Conway and soon Ravindra followed his partner to the pavilion.</p>
<p>Skipper Kane Williamson fell for 14 and Mark Chapaman was run out but Daryl Mitchell&#8217;s attacking 43 ensured an easy way home despite his departure 10 runs short of the target.</p>
<p>Boult returned figures of 3-37 after the Kiwis elected to field first and bundled out Sri Lanka for 171 in 46.4 overs.</p>
<p>Opener Kusal Perera smashed 51 but the rest of the batting fell apart.<br />
Sri Lanka slipped to 128-9 before number nine Maheesh Theekshana (38 not out) and Dilshan Madushanka (19) put on a 43-run 10th-wicket to add some respect to the total.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka lost half their side for 70 inside 10 overs after Lockie Ferguson sent back the left-handed Perera, who hit nine fours and two sixes in his 28-ball knock.</p>
<p>Perera was dropped on nought by wicketkeeper Tom Latham off Tim Southee who struck with a wicket on the next ball to send back Pathum Nissanka, caught behind for two.</p>
<p>Boult then took the wickets of skipper Kusal Mendis (six), Sadeera Samarawickrama (one) and Charith Asalanka (eight), who was given not out but the Kiwis successfully reviewed the decision in their favour.</p>
<p>The Mendis strike was Boult&#8217;s 50th World Cup wicket Cup to enter elite company including Glenn McGrath, Muttiah Muralitharan, Mitchell Starc, Lasith Malinga and Wasim Akram.</p>
<p>Leg-spinner Mitchell Santner struck twice with his left-arm spin to claim the key wickets of Angelo Mathews (16) and Dhananjaya de Silva (19).</p>
<p>Mathews looked dejected after being caught at slip off Santner&#8217;s left-arm spin in his first innings after his &#8220;timed out&#8221; dismissal &#8212; the first in international cricket history &#8212; in the team&#8217;s previous loss to Bangladesh.<br />
Sri Lanka suffered their seventh loss in nine league matches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh ended their World Cup campaign with yet another comprehensive defeat as they lost to Australia by eight wickets at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune on Saturday.</p>
<p>Bangladesh surpassed the 300-run mark for the first time in this tournament as they posted 306-8 after losing the toss but it proved inadequate in the batting paradise against a mighty batting side.</p>
<p>Mitchell Marsh, who went back home before the last match for some personal reasons, picked up his second century of the tournament to help his side finish the group stage strongly.</p>
<p>With the defeat Bangladesh finished the tournament with only four points. They have won their first match in the tournament against Afghanistan and could fetch only another win when they beat Sri Lanka in their eighth match.</p>
<p>Despite the loss, Bangladesh have done enough to finish over Sri Lanka thanks to their superior run-rate. If Netherlands, who also have four points like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, lose their last game against India on Sunday, Bangladesh will finish on top eight and get the chance to play in the next Champions Trophy.</p>
<p>Taskin Ahmed gave an early hope while defending the score as he removed Travis Head for just 10. The left-handed batter dragged a length delivery and saw his team reduced to 12-1 in the third over.</p>
<p>But it was all about Marsh after that. He added 120 with David Warner before adding another 175 with Steven Smith.</p>
<p>Batting one down, Marsh was harsh to all the bowlers and picked up boundaries at ease. He picked up 17 fours and nine sixes in his 132-ball innings with a strike rate of over 130. He seemed to struggle with cramps amidst heat later in the innings yet that could not prevent him from hitting big shots.</p>
<p>Warner, on the other hand, would rue for missing the ton. The left-handed batter got out for 53 when he was caught by Najmul Hossain, the Bangladesh skipper, at mid-on off a Mustafizur Rahman slower delivery.</p>
<p>Smith played the second fiddle with Marsh yet he ended on 63 off 64 when he played the winning boundary.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day Bangladesh took field with three changes as Shakib al Hasan was unable to play for his injury while pacers Tanzid Tamim and Shoriful Islam were dropped. Nasum Ahmed, Mahedi Hasan and Mustafizur Rahman were included in the eleven.</p>
<p>Bangladesh got off to a good start as both the openers utilised the hard new ball and fielding restriction on a placid wicket before Tanzid Hasan was dismissed for 36. He failed to negotiate a Sean Abbott delivery and was caught and bowled. Bangladesh reached 100 in the 16th over but Litton played another poor shot when he tried to whack leg-spinner Adam Zampa to be caught at long on for 36 and leaving the side on 106-2.</p>
<p>Bangladesh lost their next two wickets in irresponsible manner as Najmul and Mahmudullah both got run out scoring 45 and 32 respectively. Mushfiqur Rahim also dragged a short-pitched ball of Zampa to be caught at short cover for 21.</p>
<p>Despite the batters throwing their wickets after being set only Towhid Hridoy could reach his fifty but the dismissal of the young batter epitomized Bangladesh batting as he was caught at long on off a Marcus Stoinis full toss.</p>
<p>Mehidy Hasan Miraz scored 29 off 20 to help his side get past the 300-run mark but that was never enough. However, that may prove to be enough for Bangladesh to finish in the top eight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inter Miami saluted Argentine star Lionel Messi&#8217;s eighth Ballon d&#8217;Or on Friday, but their friendly match to mark the achievement ended in a 2-1 loss to MLS rivals New York City FC.</p>
<p>The defeat, in a match between two teams long out of the MLS championship running, was just a footnote on a celebratory night that began with Messi offering his thanks to fans for the welcome he&#8217;d received in Florida.</p>
<p>Fans, many of them shouting &#8220;Messi! Messi!&#8221; in unison, nearly filled the DRV PNK stadium &#8212; despite the fact that the club&#8217;s MLS season ended last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for being here, for this beautiful tribute,&#8221; Messi said after raising the trophy he&#8217;d collected in Paris last month. &#8220;I have been here for a short time, but it seems like a lot of time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to thank all the people of Miami, not only those who are here, but in the city in general, for the treatment I and my family have received during this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;They showed me a lot of affection, they made me feel at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 36-year-old superstar received a rapturous welcome when he arrived at Inter Miami in July and powered the struggling franchise to the Leagues Cup title in a tournament with MLS and Mexican league clubs in August.</p>
<p>He played his first MLS regular season match for Miami on August 26 as a second-half substitute, scoring a goal in Inter&#8217;s 2-0 win at New York Red Bulls to snap an 11-match winless streak.</p>
<p>But nagged by a late-season leg injury, Messi was unable to lift Miami from the league cellar into the MLS Cup playoffs.</p>
<p>Even so, he has electrified the US league, his appeal underscored by a spike in jersey sales and a rise in sales of MLS season pass viewing subscriptions as well as ticket sales wherever Miami played.</p>
<p>Fans were chanting for him again late in Friday&#8217;s match, but he was unable to produce an equalizer in a contest won by NYCFC with goals from Talles Magno and Julian Fernandez.</p>
<p>Messi&#8217;s latest Ballon d&#8217;Or rewarded exploits achieved well before his move to MLS, namely his inspirational performances at last year&#8217;s World Cup in Qatar where he scored seven goals and was named the tournament&#8217;s best player as he carried Argentina to victory.</p>
<p>But Messi said he was aiming to build on Miami&#8217;s Leagues Cup crown next season &#8212; when his club will defend that title and compete in the US Open Cup and CONCACAF Champions Cup in addition to their MLS campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no doubt that we were going to have a good time, that we were going to enjoy ourselves and today I have even less doubts that next year is going to be much better,&#8221; he said.</p>
